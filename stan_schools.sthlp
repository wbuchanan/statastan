{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:stan_schools} fits a hierarchical (multilevel) linear regression model using Stan by populating the "Schools" example code, originally written for BUGS


{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Main}

{phang}
{opt modelfile} name (and path if desired) of the text file to contain the .stan model code; it is always replaced without warning

{phang}
{opt clusterid} variable that defines the clusters (the "schools"), which must be in consecutive intgers

{phang}
{opt rslopes} variables that have random slopes (alphas)

{phang}
{opt rslopes} global macros that should be sent to Stan as scalars

{phang}
{opt betapriors} Stan code fragment defining the prior shared among the fixed effect coefficients; default is "normal(0,100)"

{phang}
{opt hetvar} variable that explains heteroskedasticity by linearly predicting the log-variance of the observation-level errors

{phang}
{opt thetaprior} Stan code fragment defining the prior for theta, the constant in the heteroskedasticity equation; default is "normal(0,100)"

{phang}
{opt phiprior} Stan code fragment defining the prior for phi, the coefficient of {it:hetvar} in the heteroskedasticity equation; default is "normal(0,100)"

{phang}
{opt sdeprior} Stan code fragment defining the prior for the error standard deviation when {it:hetvar} is not specified; default is "normal(0,100)", which is truncated by the definition of sde in the parameter block so it is half-normal

{phang}
{opt gammaprior} Stan code fragment defining the prior for gamma, the vector of means for the random effects (alphas); default is a vector of zeros

{phang}
{opt sigmaprior} Stan code fragment defining the prior for Sigma, the covariance matrix for the random effects (alphas); default has 100 on the diagonal and zero off-diagonal

{phang}
{opt stanopts} options to be passed to {helpb stan}; you should not specify modelfile inside stanopts

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
The BUGS example, its translation onto Stan, and the various files used in the example are all at https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/wiki/BUGS-Examples-Sorted-Alphabetically

{pstd}
For consistency with the BUGS example, stan_schools maintains the same Greek letters as in BUGS, despite them being unusual in places. We assume hetvar is in varlist.

{marker prior}{...}
{title:Priors in Stan code}

{pstd}
To fully understand the options available to you in the prior specification, refer to the Stan manual at http://mc-stan.org/documentation/

{pstd}
In brief, in each of the prior options, you can provide a string that will be inserted into the Stan code for the parameter(s) in question. For example, by typing {cmd:betapriors("normal(0,2)")}, that string will be inserted into a line in Stan for the beta parameters:

{pstd}
{cmd:beta ~ normal(0,2);}

{pstd} which will impose a normal prior for each beta, with mean 0 and standard deviation 2. You can also use distributions such as lognormal(), student_t(), cauchy(), uniform() or beta(). Remember that unknown values defined in the parameters block (which is the case for all the priors in stan_schools) cannot be discretely distributed; this is a limitation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and hence Stan (at present).
